### Setup frontend development environment

You will need yarn to install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install -g yarn
```

And you need next.js:

```shell
npm install -g next@11
```

The frontend files are in the `frontend/` directory:

```sh
cd frontend
```

Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

Build and compile the frontend static files:

```shell
yarn export
```

To start development, use:

```shell
yarn dev
```
